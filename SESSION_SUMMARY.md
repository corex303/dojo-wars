## 🔧 Issues Fixed This Session

### ❌ Problem: BOLT Deploy Command Error
```bash
bolt deploy --network devnet
error: unexpected argument '--network' found
```

### ✅ Solution: Fixed in `.github/workflows/deploy-devnet.yml`
```yaml
# OLD (incorrect)
- name: Deploy programs
  run: bolt deploy --network devnet

# NEW (correct)
- name: Configure Solana for devnet
  run: solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

- name: Deploy programs
  run: bolt deploy
```

**Explanation**: BOLT CLI uses Solana CLI configuration, not direct `--network` flags.

## 📖 How to Use the Migration Plan

### The `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` is Your Command Center

**Purpose**: Preserve context across multiple chat sessions without relying on chat history.

**How It Works**:
1. **Start of session**: Open `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` and read the UPDATE LOG
2. **During work**: Update checkboxes `[ ]` to `[x]` as you complete tasks
3. **End of session**: Add entry to UPDATE LOG with:
   - Date
   - What was accomplished
   - Any blockers encountered
   - Next priority
4. **Next session**: Start by reading the latest UPDATE LOG entry

**Example Update Log Entry**:
```markdown
### 2025-01-16 (Session 2)
- ✅ Created GitHub repository
- ✅ Deployed all programs to devnet
- ✅ Frontend connecting to wallet successfully
- 🔲 Blocked: Need to implement BOLT SDK integration
- 🎯 Next: Complete Phase 2.1 (Create BOLT Client)
```

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture
✅ **BOLT ECS** over vanilla Anchor (composability, gas efficiency)  
✅ **Phaser + React** hybrid (UI in React, game in Phaser)  
✅ **Zustand** for state (simple, TypeScript-first)  
✅ **Vite** for bundling (fast, modern)  

### Deployment
✅ BOLT CLI uses Solana config, not `--network` flag  
✅ GitHub Actions has separate config step  
✅ Manual deployment workflow for control  

### Code Organization
✅ All integration TODOs marked with `// TODO:`  
✅ TypeScript types mirror Rust structs  
✅ Phase-by-phase approach  
✅ Living documentation (MIGRATION_PLAN.md)  

---

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### User Experience
- **Progressive Costs**: Balances economy (recruiting gets expensive)
- **Training Cooldowns**: Prevents spam, encourages strategy
- **Elemental System**: Rock-paper-scissors adds depth
- **Auto-Battle**: Low cognitive load, mobile-friendly
- **Session Keys**: Gasless gameplay in ER

### Technical Excellence
- **Type Safety**: ~0% `any` types in TypeScript
- **Modular**: Easy to add new ninjas, weapons, systems
- **Documented**: Every file has clear purpose
- **Tested**: CI/CD catches issues early
- **Scalable**: ECS pattern supports complex features
