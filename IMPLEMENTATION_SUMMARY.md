## üéØ Current State

### ‚úÖ Fully Functional (Development Ready)
1. Complete BOLT program architecture
2. Full game logic for core gameplay loop
3. Beautiful, responsive UI with Phaser integration
4. Type-safe end-to-end TypeScript
5. State management with Zustand
6. Battle engine with animations
7. MagicBlock integration infrastructure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Integration (Marked with TODOs)
1. **BOLT SDK Connection**: Frontend needs to call actual deployed programs
2. **MagicBlock SDK**: Delegation and VRF functions need actual SDK calls
3. **Session Key Authorization**: Needs MagicBlock session key program
4. **Program Deployment**: Backend needs to be built and deployed to devnet

### üé® Needs Assets
- All visuals are placeholders (colored circles, emoji)
- Ninja sprites, weapon icons, dojo background needed
- Sound effects and music
